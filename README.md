# üöÄ GitHub Actions - CI/CD Made Simple


<img src="https://github.com/bhuvan-raj/Github-Actions/blob/main/githubactions.webp" alt="Banner" />


GitHub Actions is GitHub's native CI/CD platform that enables you to automate your development workflows directly from your repository. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code automatically whenever you push code or open pull requests.

## üß† Why GitHub Actions?

While there are many CI/CD tools available (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI), GitHub Actions offers several unique advantages:

- **Native GitHub Integration** ‚Äì No external setup or plugins needed.
- **Simple YAML Configuration** ‚Äì Define workflows as code with ease.
- **Free Minutes for Public Repos** ‚Äì Ideal for open-source and learning projects.
- **Tight PR & Issue Hooks** ‚Äì Trigger workflows directly from GitHub events.
- **Built-in Marketplace** ‚Äì Thousands of pre-built actions available.

Whether you're a beginner or a DevOps practitioner, GitHub Actions makes automation simple and powerful.
